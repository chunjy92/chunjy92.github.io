<p>
  Welcome!
</p>

<p>
  Here you will find a brief introduction about myself, along with several works that I was fortunate to be part of in both the academic and IT industry sector.
  While I once aspired to create everything on this website (including images, icons and web-design), I make it known here that this app owes its look to <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">Lagrange</a>, so many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/LeNPaul" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">LeNPaul</a> for creating this beautiful Jekyll theme.
</p>

<p>
  By the way, if you are among those few who thought I was onto something for creating everything.. <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/{{ site.data.settings.pages[4].path }}" style="text-decoration:none"><b>hm</b></a>.
</p>

<p>
  Anyhow, thanks for visiting!
</p>
