My name is Jayeol Chun, and I am an aspiring NLP & Machine Learning researcher who probably loves reading and writing more than coding and math-ing. With that said, this website is an attempt to combine these two geeky sides of me, where I get to write about and introduce classic papers as well latest publications on above and related fields, about my own research and other side projects, and from time to time about my daily life (Korean readers are referred to [my Korean blog](http://aprilharu.tistory.com), which I have been managing on and off since 2012). 
 
 Allow me to rephrase: *Optimizing life*, that's what this website (and my life) is about.
